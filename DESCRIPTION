Maintainer: Thomas Terhoeven-Urselmans <t.urselmans@cgiar.org>
Description: This package combines existing R functions with new code
        for soil spectral analysis. The result is an easy to use tool
        for (i) importing of spc-files, (ii) principal component
        analysis, (iii) sample selection using the Kennard-Stone
        algorithm, (iv) spectral transformation and (v) comparison of
        regression methods.
